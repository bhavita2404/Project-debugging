No, Shapiro-wilk test tests for normality of a distribution. You should
use one sided Wilcoxon Sign Rank test.

Assume that X is a vector containing the mean values that you compute for
all the activity matrices using fault localization metric P and Y is a
vector containing the same using metric Q.

Now, you want to test whether P is statistically better than Q. For any
matrix i, if Xi is lesser than Yi, then it means P performs better than Q
for matrix i. So, if P is better than Q, ideally the vector (Y-X) should
contain all positive values.

So, you want to test the null hypothesis that the median of (Y-X) is less
than or equal to 0 against the alternate hypothesis that it is greater
than 0.

You can use library calls in Matlab or R where you can plug in X and Y and
get the p-value.
